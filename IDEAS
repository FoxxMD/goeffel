- Data emission: allow for emitting data into a metrics pipeline via network

- HDF5 file management:  build in a concept that allows for "running this
  permanently" while consuming predictable disk space. Something along the lines
  of truncation, building a retention policy, or generally "file rotation").

- File management in general: prevent accidental concurrent write access.
  Simple: check if file exists. More complex: file locking.

- For the magic plot allow for a non-interactive mode which only writes to disk.

- Note that this program must be run as root (in docs) and also generate nice
  error messages around that.

Ideas for walk-through / tutorial / blog:

- Show how PID command picks up new PID
- Show inspect
- Show magic
- Show non-interactive magic, writing PNG file

Ideas for messer-analysis specifically:

    - control log level with command line flag

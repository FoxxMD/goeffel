## Data collection

- Use eBPF for acquiring advanced kernel statistics:
    - https://pypi.org/project/pyebpf/
    - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc


## Data emission

- allow for emitting data into a metrics pipeline via network (statsd, ...)


## File management

- File management in general: prevent accidental concurrent write access.
  Example scenario: messer started twice with default args in the same second.
  File locking?


## messer-analysis

- For the magic plot allow for a non-interactive mode which only writes to disk.

- control log level with command line flag

- make non-interactive mode default because of the figure size issue:
  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7338
  Write PDF and PNG by default.


## Ideas for walk-through / tutorial / blog:

- Show how PID command picks up new PID
- Show inspect
- Show magic
- Show non-interactive magic, writing PNG file


## Misc notes

- messer cmdline args: make first argument positional arg, and auto-detect
  whether it's an integer (PID) or otherwise PID command (cleaner semantics)

- build a mode without process-specific monitoring (no pid, no pid command)?

- measure resource utilization of messer with another instance of messer.

- Replace HDF5 type for columns with unit 'percent' to be Float16 instead of Float32?

- architecture: if the sample writer crashes for whichever reason we want to
  crash the entire program, right?

- sampling loop timekeeping:

    - use deadline-based approach with a periodic poll
      to minimize a systematic error dominating the sample time stamps
      (sample interval + sample duration).

    - think once again about which timestamp to associate with the sample.

    - maybe emit monotonic time source into its own column, so that system
      clock drift can be measured / excluded

- Allow for installing `schiepel` w/o the depdencies required solely for
  `schniepel-analysis`.

- Add option to not measure IP connections? Can be CPU costly. Measure/compare.
  Does this matter?

- On a loaded system profile schniepel and see where it spends its time.
  Pops up in top with 6 % CPU utilization. A quick `perf top` on the
  sampling process shows that it spends most of its time in kernel space,
  not too bad:

    Overhead  Shared Object         Symbol
      14.90%  [kernel]              [k] vsnprintf
      14.87%  [kernel]              [k] established_get_first.isra.40
      11.22%  [kernel]              [k] format_decode
       6.13%  [kernel]              [k] number.isra.2
